blueprint  retroviru  gene  ar  backward  thei  ar  made  of  rna  to  get  go  the  viru  ha  to  translat  them  into  dna  thi  i  the  job  of  enzym  made  by  a  gene  call  pol  like  other  retrovirus  hiv  ha  three  basic  gene  besid  pol  thei  ar  env  which  make  gp  and  gp  to  form  the  outer  shell  and  gag  which  creat  the  protein  need  for  the  viruss  inner  core  howev  unlik  simpl  retrovirus  hiv  ha  at  least  four  regulatori  gene  and  probabl  more  thei  ar  call  tat  art  sor  and  orf  even  though  scientist  have  work  out  the  entir  genet  code  of  the  aid  viruss  rna  thei  ar  not  sure  how  mani  gene  ar  involv  in  all  some  of  them  overlap  share  stretch  of  rna  while  other  gene  ar  splice  togeth  from  here  and

 instruct  the  cell  to  turn  it  attent  toward  make  and  assembl  viral  protein  in  t  helper  cell  howev  thi  usual  doesnt  happen  even  though  on  in  five  of  them  mai  be  infect  onli  about  on  in  i  actual  produc  viral  protein  in  the  rest  of  them  the  viru  li  quiet  or  latent  it  can  come  to  life  onli  when  the  t  helper  cell  itself  i  stimul  by  some  immunolog  emerg  to  divid  and  produc  new  cell  thi  i  not  true  of  monocyt  and  macrophag  in  these  cell  the  viru  can  make  a  slow  steadi  stream  of  new  virus  or  suddenli  explod  with  activ  but  whether  ani  of  these  infect  cell  actual  churn  out  new  virus  depend  on  an  intric  interplai  between  the  viruss  regulatori  gene  among  the  most  intrigu  of  these  i  tat  it  a  kind  of  fastforward  switch  tat  produc  a  protein  that  caus  the  other  gene  to  work  faster  it  can  spe  up  viru  product  fold  the  tat  protein  even  make

and  it  mai  be  on  wai  that  the  viru  establish  latent  infect  anoth  wai  i  through  the  art  gene  also  known  a  tr  art  i  a  kind  of  switch  when  art  i  turn  on  the  viru  make  the  structur  protein  necessari  for  construct  new  copi  of  itself  but  when  art  i  turn  off  it  make  onli  the  regulatori  protein  final  there  i  sor  it  protein  somehow  make  the  viru  more  infecti  so  it  spread  more  rapidli  through  the  bodi  us  these  gene  hiv  transform  us  cell  into  viru  factori  most  of  the  infect  cell  surviv  even  though  thei  ar  make  viru  howev  the  t  helper  cell  eventu  die  and  thei  ar  kill  in  two  wai  when  cell  ar  infect  with  hiv  thei  often  displai  copi  of  the  viruss  envelop  protein  on  their

 when  it  find  on  it  stick  to  it  thi  result  in  clump  of  to  cell  known  a  syncytia  and  all  of  them  eventu  die  the  t  helper  cell  mai  also  die  through  a  process  call  autofus  the  surfac  of  these  cell  contain  so  much  envelop  protein  and  t  that  it  skin  fold  over  onto  itself  and  stick  togeth  each  place  that  envelop  protein  and  t  touch  a
