 a  sad  close  chapter  to  the  fail  stori  of  reaganom  the  administr  predict  that  if  it  budget  i  adopt  deficit  would  continu  to  retreat  from  the  record  level  earlier  in

the  presid  who  will  follow  thi  administr  becaus  of  the  deficit  he  will  inherit  the  administr  figur  ar  base  on  project  that  econom  growth  will  continu  undiminish  by  last
